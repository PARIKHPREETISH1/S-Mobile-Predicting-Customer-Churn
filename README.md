# Predicting Customer Churn in Subscription Services

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a subscription based service using data analytics and machine learning techniques. The objective is to identify customers who are likely to churn and uncover the key factors driving churn, enabling businesses to take proactive retention actions.

## Problem Statement
Customer churn directly impacts revenue and long term growth for subscription businesses. The challenge is to analyze large scale customer data to:
- Identify churn patterns
- Predict which customers are at risk of leaving
- Provide actionable insights to improve customer retention

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains customer level information including:
- Demographics
- Account details
- Usage behavior
- Subscription and service features
- Churn label (Yes or No)

---

## Approach
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature Engineering  
4. Model Building and Evaluation  
5. Insight Generation and Business Recommendations  

---

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

Models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC AUC to balance performance and interpretability.

---

## Key Insights
- Contract type and tenure are strong predictors of churn  
- Customers on month to month contracts churn more frequently  
- Higher service usage and longer tenure reduce churn probability  

---

## Business Impact
- Helps businesses identify high risk customers early  
- Enables targeted retention campaigns  
- Supports data driven decision making for pricing and subscription strategies  

---

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Future Improvements
- Implement uplift modeling for targeted retention actions  
- Incorporate customer lifetime value (CLV)  
- Deploy model using a dashboard or API
